# Auto-Deploy (Hassle free deployment for your web applications)

It is a cloud platform much like vercel, which I tried creating from scratch.

It allows the user to simply feed the link to their github repo, click "Upload" and the system will do all the heavy-lifting for you, will retrieve the files, build it on own it's servers and will finally spit out the deployed link to your web-application.

It has a very simple interface, currently stripped off of all the fanciful decorations.
